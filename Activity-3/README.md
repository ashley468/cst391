## Part1
## Screenshot 1

![Big](big.png)
- This is a screenshot of my the begginig/home page in the way I edited it. I deleted the code in it and added a grid from the bootstrap. The devtools show what it would look like in a laptop/computer
![Small](small.png)
- This is a screenshot of the devtools showing what it would look like in a different device, which is a phone in this case. 



## Part2

![InitialApplication](initialApplication.png)
- This is a screenshot of the initial aplication page.

![GCUHomePage](gcuHomePage.png)
- This is a screenshot of GCU's Home page. When clicking on this button, it takes the user to GCU's acutal home page, so this isn't a page that we created. 

![CreateAlbumPage](createAlbumPage.png)
- This is a screenshot of the create album page. In this page, the user inserts the information of an artist, their album, description, year, etc. 

![AlbumsListPage](albumsListPage.png)
- This is a screenshot of the albums list page. This list page shows a list of albums titles that are already stored in the application and/or the new ones that the user might add. 

![Aboutbox](aboutBox.png)
- This is a screenshot of the about box. Unlike the rest of the screenshots, this isn't a page, it's a box/message that appears at the top that says "My Music Collection Version: 1.0".

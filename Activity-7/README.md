## Screenshots Part 1
![MiniBlog0](miniBlog0.png)
- This is a screenshot of the Mini blog page once it starts running. It shows the available blogs and gives the reader options to add and delete. 

![MiniBlogAdd](miniBlogAdd.png)
- This is a screenshot of the mini blog if the user decides to add a blog entry. The user adds whatever they want, click the "Add" button, then at the bottom it adds the text with the new entry number. In this case, the entry number is 1 since the first was 0. 

![MiniBlogDelete](miniBlogDelete.png)
- This is a screenshot of the mini blog if the user decides to delete a blog entry. The user decides the entry they want to delete, click the "Delete" button, then that entry will be deleted. For this example I decided to delete entry #0, so it now only shows blog entry #1.
